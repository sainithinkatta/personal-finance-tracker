## 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in project root:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
# Optional: adjust how many days ahead reminders are prepared (defaults to 7)
VITE_REMINDER_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS=7
```

For the Supabase edge function, you can override the same reminder horizon with:

```bash
REMINDER_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS=7
```

If the variables are not set, both code paths fall back to the shared default of 7 days.
